## Deployment

#### Deploying on GitHub pages
* After creating all of the neccessary files for my project on VScode I committed the bulk of my code to GitHub.
* After pulling all the code I navigated to my project repo.
* I clicked the settings button in the nav bar
* I then scrolled down and clicked the pages button on the left hand side of the screen.
* After navigating successfully to the GitHub pages section, scroll to where it says branch. 
* I picked the branch and selected the desired folder.
* I clicked the save button.
* I watched the build to check it was successful and then opened the website by scrolling back up and clicking the deployment link where it says "your site is live".

#### Forking the GitHub Repository
By forking the GitHub Repository you will be able to make a copy of the original repository on your own GitHub account allowing you to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository by using the following steps:

* Log in to GitHub and locate the GitHub Repository.
* At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" button on the menu, locate the "Fork" button.
* You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.

#### Making a local clone
* Log in to GitHub and locate the GitHub Repository.
* Under the repository name, click "Clone or download".
* To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "Clone with HTTPS", copy the link.
* Open commandline interface on your computer.
* Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
* Type git clone, and then paste the URL you copied above.
* Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.
